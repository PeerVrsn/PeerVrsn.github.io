<h2>What is the Kazakhstan Exchange?</h2>
<p>The Kazakhstan Exchange is an exchange that was planned by Mr. Collins and Aidar Khoroshash, after Mr. Collins had visited the Nazarbayev Intellectual School with the CIS (Council Of International Schools) to decide whether NIS should be part of the CIS. After that, the Kazakhstan exchange was actively planned from both sides, and then after agreeing on the most important information around the exchange. This year (2017), the exchange took place from the 9th to the 15th September. ISHR has sent two students (Franka and Peer) and a teacher (Ms. García Villa) to Astana to visit the school. Then, from the 22nd to the 28th October, ten students and two teachers from NIS visited Hannover. This exchange was initially only planned as an experiment, however Mr. Collins and Mr. Khoroshash are working on making this exchange take place every year and increasing the number of students going to Kazakhstan.</p>
