<h2>Differences: </h2>
        A few of the differences between Germany and Kazakhstan were the religion, because here in Germany it is over two thirds Christianity and in Kazakhstan it is over two thirds Muslim. It was surprising that there were only two big cities in the whole country and the rest were mostly smaller villages. There was also a lot of greenspace unaffected from pollution and littering. The roads were mostly made out of dirt outside of the city, because not as many cars drive past there. They also had meals involving a lot of meat and had totally different food than here in Germany. They also prepared the food in very different ways. The traditional clothing was also very different from German traditional clothing.
