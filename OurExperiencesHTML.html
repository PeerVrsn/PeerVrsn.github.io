<p>"The exchange to Kazakhstan has really opened up my mind, as we have learnt a lot about the Kazakh culture, which we could also compare to our German culture. We have received probably the warmest welcoming culture from all the people that we have met during the exchange, whether they knew us or they didn't. The exchange has also been a lot of fun for all of the people involved (including the Kazakh students), since we did lots of fun activities. Also, I would recommend to everybody that is interested in learning about a new culture or also wants to meet new people from another country, to sign up for this exchange. As none of us spoke any Russian or Kazakh (although Ms. García Villa spoke a little Bulgarian), not being able to speak the language of the country you're visiting will not be a problem due to the Kazakh students helping."</p>
